# Piscine Data Science - 0 Creation of a DB

## Introduction

This project aims to explore the foundational aspects of data engineering, specifically focusing on the creation and management of databases. The exercises within this project emphasize the importance of data cleansing and transformation, which are crucial for preparing data for analysis by data analysts and data scientists. Understanding these processes is essential for anyone entering the field of data science.

## Why is Database Creation Relevant?

Creating a robust database is a critical first step in data engineering. A well-structured database allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, which are vital for any data-driven decision-making process. This project provides hands-on experience in setting up a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that data is properly organized and accessible for future analysis.

## How to Run

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Create Postgres DB
- **Description**: Set up a PostgreSQL database named `piscineds` with the specified username and password.
- **Relevance**: This exercise is crucial for understanding how to create and manage a database, which is the foundation of data engineering.

### Exercise 01: Show Me Your DB
- **Description**: Use a database visualization tool (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver) to easily visualize and manipulate your database.
- **Relevance**: This exercise emphasizes the importance of being able to browse and manage data effectively.

### Exercise 02: First Table
- **Description**: Create a PostgreSQL table using data from a CSV file located in the customer folder. The table must be named after the CSV file and include at least six different data types.
- **Relevance**: This exercise highlights the importance of data types in database design and ensures proper data organization.

### Exercise 03: Automatic Table
- **Description**: Automatically retrieve all CSV files from the customer folder and create a table for each one, named after the corresponding CSV file.
- **Relevance**: This exercise demonstrates automation in database management, which is essential for handling large datasets efficiently.

### Exercise 04: Items Table
- **Description**: Create a table named `items` using the column names provided in the `items.csv` file, ensuring it contains at least three different data types.
- **Relevance**: This exercise reinforces the importance of data structure and type diversity in database design.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to the creation and management of databases within the context of data science. By completing these project, gain practical experience in setting up databases, managing data, and preparing it for analysis, which are essential skills for any data engineer.
